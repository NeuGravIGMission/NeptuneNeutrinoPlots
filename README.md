# NeptuneNeutrinoPlots
This repositary holds all of the plots that were created for the Neutrino simulations in Neptune's atmosphere.
The plots that were studied are broken down into two main sections with Cherenkov and Scintillation simulation runs. 

Now the Cherenkov portion has 5 folders located inside. Four of the folders correspond to the detector size simulations that were ran going from a 1,2,5, and 10 meter diameter detector. The Fifth folder corresponds to the entire distribution of Cherenkov photons leaving the atmosphere and incident on a 100x100km array of 1km sized detectors. The particles that were studied were electrons, muons, and tau particles that were created from the galactic neutrinos interacting with Neptune's atmosphere, and their energies ranged from 10 GeV to 10 TeV.

In the Scintillation folder, there are two subfolders where one corresponds to the entire Scintillation distribution just like the previous one mentioned. Then the other folder only looks at the 10 meter sized detector ranging again over the various particles and energies previously mentioned.

The source data for this research is located with the NuSol project on our portable hard drive for safe keeping. But additional studies and plots will be presented later when the memory leak in the GEANT4 simulation can be located.
